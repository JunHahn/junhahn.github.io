My old website and blog theme had been feeling kind of outdated for a while. When I bumped into the nice, mobile-friendly [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/), it was clear that I needed to change my site. After a busy summer with my family I finally found the time to make the update. 

Some things I would like to add in the future:

* Share buttons, at least Twitter
* Tags with a way to search and list posts based on them

Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! I also hope I can keep up with more regular posting from now on.
