Last week I participated the [Aalto Digi Breakfast on Data Science](http://www.aalto.fi/en/research/platforms/digi/data_science/). The Digi Breakfast meetings cover timely topics in digitalization in Aalto University, and the aim is to better connect the world-class research and companies in the Helsinki area.

The program was quite tight, with a lot of short and even shorter talks from both Aalto and companies. There were lots of familiar faces from my time in the Aalto university and [HIIT](http://www.hiit.fi/), and it was interesting to now listen to the talks from the company side.

The first keynote was given by [Hekki Mannila](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikki_Mannila), a famous computer scientist and current president of the Academy of Finland. He gave the following ten suggestions for data scientists (*emphasis mine*):

1. Think big - *look for really big opportunities*
2. Think small - *start with easy wins*
3. Do not follow the herd - *explore new problem domains*
4. Talk to people in other camps
5. Work on a few things
6. Do not assume that only size matters - *small data can be more important than big data*
7. Beware and take advantage of technological development
8. Simplify - *small models often work best*
9. Assume infinite computational power
10. Have fun!

I really liked these, especially the ones about not following the herd! Through the open knowledge community I have had the opportunity to talk people from a wide range of background, which as been really eye-opening and also produced a lot of data science application ideas. 

Next Johanna Bragge and Jukka Nurminen presented resent developments in the data science education in Aalto University. These included a new minor in analytics and data science, and ideas for a data science project course and/or hackathon (such as [this](http://www.meetup.com/Green-Campus-CIVIS/events/178850142/)), where companies could provide some interesting data for the students to play with. Here I suggested also using open data that could be used to study important societal challenges.

In the research spotlights from Aalto, [Sami Kaski](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/mi/) (my Phd supervisor) summarised the research conducted in the [Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference Research (COIN)](http://research.ics.aalto.fi/coin/). The focus of COIN is to create both faster inference methods for statistical models and models that scale to really large data sets.

Keijo Heljanko introduced [Aalto Data Hub](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=6776309&trk=anet_ug_hm), a networking group for data science researchers and companies. Concrete ideas were to share interesting data sets and also experiences in using big data tools. The open source [bigdata cluster](https://github.com/avaus/bigdata-cluster) we have been developing at Avaus should be relevant here. 

Ville Peltola talked about creative discovery and especially the ever-interesting [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/), "cognitive computing system". Watson has been now applied to [cooking](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/cognitivecooking/), and an [API](https://developer.ibm.com/watson/) is also provided for developers. Nice! 

Also a couple of companies gave short talks. [CSC - IT Center for Science](http://www.csc.fi/english) is building [data science services](http://www.csc.fi/english/csc/overview/service_areas/data_storage_services), and their [Pouta](http://www.csc.fi/english/research/Computing_services/computing/pouta) cloud could be a good alternative for Amazon with data stored in Finland. Other companies present including [Comptel](http://www.comptel.com/), [ZenRobotics](http://www.zenrobotics.com/product/), [Reaktor](http://reaktor.fi/) and [Elisa](http://www.elisa.com/en/). They boasted with their data science expertise and/or expressed interests in research collaboration.

All in all, a very good session in just one and a half hours. Will look forward to the future sessions and maybe even presenting something related to open data or my data, who knows.
