The first independent think tank in Finland, [Demos Helsinki](http://www.demoshelsinki.fi/), turned 10 years last week (more in this [post](http://www.demoshelsinki.fi/2015/09/09/suomen-ensimmainen-riippumaton-ajatushautomo-demos-helsinki-tayttaa-10-vuotta/) in Fnnish). I have had the pleasure of working with this great group of talented and insightful people, and I wanted to congratulate them on their anniversary. So I made these streamgraphs showing the top Twitter hashtags used by few of the key Demos people, providing a nice timeline of the themes the think tank has been working on in the past.

Below is another graph showing the activity of each Demos author on Twitter. This one is clearly dominated by the two founders, [Roope Mokka](https://twitter.com/mokka) and [Aleksi Neuvonen](https://twitter.com/leksis). Recently they also started using the common [@DemosHelsinki](https://twitter.com/demoshelsinki) account.
