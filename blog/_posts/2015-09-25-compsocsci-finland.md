Data science is spreading throughout business sectors and research fields. [Computational social sciences](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/721) is a field that *"leverages the capacity to collect and analyze data at a scale that may reveal patterns of individual and group behaviors"*. This is highly interesting and not too far from many business-oriented data science use cases where the aim is to understand customer behavior. 

I was thus very excited to participate the first International Conference on Computational Social Science ([ICCSS](http://iccss2015.eu/)), held in Helsinki in June. Organised by [Santo Fortunato](https://twitter.com/santo_fortunato) and collegues from Aalto University, the event was a great success with over 500 submitted abstracts, 400 participants, and great practical arrangements.

The event featured a world-class lineup of keynote speakers. Below I listed some points from the talks I attended, and for full coverage you can check the presentation videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUGsbLwL4G2CQQfk95oZjVw):

* Michael Macy: Network data sets are advantageous over traditional sample surveys, as they cover also the social network context affecting people's actions and opinions, in addition to individual attributes. 
* Jure Leskovec: How feedback influences human behaviour, based on a massive Disqus data analysis. 
* Albert-Lázló Barabási: Findings from studying success in science, i.e. citation dynamics over the career of a researcher. One result: it seems to be more or less random when a scientist makes her most influential piece.
* Nicholas Christakis: How social networks influence things such as obesity and happinnes - is it induction, homophily or context?

Other high-level keynotes included Duncan Watts, and also Sandy "Social Physics" Pentland, whom I missed because I was listening to another great character, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in the nearby [Tomorrow](http://tomorrow.fi/) event. Check the nice coverage of [Taleb and his tale of hope](http://reaktor.com/blog/taleb-and-his-tale-of-hope/) in Reaktor's blog. 

From the keynotes it became clear that the first wave of computational social science research is very network-focused. This is understandable, as the popularity of social networks now allow research on interaction patterns that simply were not possible earlier. However, I hope that in the field can extend beyond networks analysis in the future. For example, the increasing amount of [open government data](http://opengovernmentdata.org/) creates interesting opportunities for computational research. A great example was presented by Veikko Eranti and colleagues in their poster [Topic Modeling the Global Climate Policy Debate](http://blogs.helsinki.fi/politicalsociology/2015/06/08/hepo-iccss2015/).

At [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) we are working to make open government data more accessible to researches. In our [poster on Open Data Analytics and Reproducible Research](http://ropengov.github.io/r/poster/latex/sweave/tikz/2015/06/07/ICCSS/) we promoted both the possibilites of open data analytics and also reproducible research. Computational social science is now in a great position to adopt the [open science practices](https://www.csc.fi/web/atcsc/-/mita-laskennalliset-yhteiskuntatieteet-voisivat-oppia-bioinformatiikalta-osa-2) developed in other fields, more matured computational science fields, such as bioinformatics.

As Reaktor was one of the sponsors of the event, I had the chance to give a talk in the *Industry meets Science* session. I presented our work on modelling and visualisation of regional apartment price data in Finland. The interactive visualisation can be found at [kannattaakokauppa.fi](http://kannattaakokauppa.fi/en/), and my slides can be found [here](http://ouzor.github.io/presentations/iccss_2015/iccss_reaktor_2015.html#1).


The event was a great start for the emerging field and we will surely see nice research to be presented in the future [events](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/news-events/conference/ic2s2/2016.aspx).
