**Jun Hahn**  is a master’s student at `the Department of Transdisciplinary Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan`. He received a bachelor’s degree in **computer science and engineering** `Dongguk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea`.  

He is interested in **Psychometrics**, **Universal Design**, and **Interaction Design** to explore visual impairment and human-centred technology with multidisciplinary research methods. In detail, he is working on a Universal Design project to create informative recycling bins by employing [pairwise comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairwise_comparison) and [Scheffé's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheffé%27s_method) with quantitatve surveys.  

As he has **computer science** background, he also runs study groups with freelancers, software engineers, and postgraduate students to learn about `machine learning` (especially for reinforcement learning), and `web development` (Golang, React/Relay, TDD/DDD, gRPC/Microservices). He is going to work for [Mercari Inc.](https://about.mercari.com/), which is the first in Japan to reach “unicorn” status, as a **Software Engineer (Backend: Golang, Microservices)** from April 2019.

**Favourite quotes:**

* The world is not a desktop. -**Mark Weiser**  
* I propose to consider the question, `'Can machines think?'` -**Alan Turing**  
* Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. -**Edsger Dijkstra**  
* Computer science inverts the normal. In normal science, you're given a world, and your job is to find out the rules. In computer science, you give the computer the rules, and it creates the world. - **Alan Kay**  
* People who are more than casually interested in computers should have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like. Otherwise the programs they write will be pretty weird. -**Donald Knuth**
