      <description>I started working as a contributor (translation Eng-Kor) for Google&amp;rsquo;s Go (golang) Programming Language, a Udemy course by Todd McLeod. Todd kindly accepted my suggestion to translate his contents in Korean and accepted my very first Pull Request.
The Github repository that I am working on is GoesToEleven/go-programming, espeically for English to Korean translation work.
I have researched some lectures/courses that seem good for a starting point to learn golang since I needed to pick a online course for a study group to learn golang (we decide to go through with a course with additonal materials) and Todd&amp;rsquo;s lectures on Udemy are highly recommended.</description>

      <description>Mercari Tech Conference 2018 at academyhills bldg., Roppongi, Minato, Tokyo
I joined Mercari Tech Conference 2018.
First, I thank to Mercari to offer free student ticket for the conference and a chance to have a lunch with their engineers and other participants.
I was able to have nice talks with some of my friends working there as well as other Mercari engineers with their current works. Even though I was trying to join most of session in general, I spent more time on some sessions that talked about Golang, Microservices, and somehow Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>Jun Hahn, ACM SIGCHI Communication Ambassador
According to United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP), population ageing in East and North-East Asia (ENEA) is distinctly remarkable as the sub-region is home to a high ratio of elder people in the world [1]. In 2015, 32% of people in the world, older than 65 years old, are living in ENEA. In Asia, 56% of the older persons are from ENEA.</description>
