title: Start translation for a famous Golang Udemy lecture
---

I started working as a contributor (translation Eng-Kor) for **Google's Go (golang) Programming Language** at Udemy by Todd McLeod.

The Github repository that I am working on is [GoesToEleven/go-programming](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/go-programming), espeically for English to Korean translation work.  

I have researched some lectures that seem good for starting point to learn golang since I also organised a study group for golang (we decide to go through with a course with additonal materials) and Todd's lectures on Udemy are highly recommended. I am happy to contribute the course. Hopefully, this will be helpful for other people who want to learn `golang` in Korean, as well as reinforce my understanding on the best programming language on this planet, IMHO!
