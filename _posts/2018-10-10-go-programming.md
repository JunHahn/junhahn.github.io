title: Started translation for a Golang Udemy course
---

I started working as a contributor (translation Eng-Kor) for **Google's Go (golang) Programming Language**, a Udemy course by Todd McLeod. Todd kindly accepted my suggestion to translate his contents in Korean and accepted my very first Pull Request.

The Github repository that I am working on is [GoesToEleven/go-programming](https://github.com/GoesToEleven/go-programming), espeically for English to Korean translation work.  

I have researched some lectures/courses that seem good for a starting point to learn `golang` since I needed to pick a online course for a study group to learn golang (we decide to go through with a course with additonal materials) and Todd's lectures on Udemy are highly recommended.  

I am glad to contribute the course by adding Korean translation as well as fixing some minor typos, etc. Hopefully, this activity is helpful for other people who want to learn `golang` in Korean, as well as reinforce my knowledge about the best programming language on this planet, IMHO!
