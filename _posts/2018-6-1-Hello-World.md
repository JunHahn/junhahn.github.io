* I propose to consider the question, `'Can machines think?'` -**Alan Turing**  
* Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. -**Edsger Dijkstra**  
* Computer science inverts the normal. In normal science, you're given a world, and your job is to find out the rules. In computer science, you give the computer the rules, and it creates the world. - **Alan Kay**
